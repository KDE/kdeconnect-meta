# KDE Connect - meta repository

KDE Connect is a multi-platform app that allows your devices to communicate (eg: your phone and your computer).

This repo aggregates docs, tasks and information that applies to all KDE Connect implementations and contains no code. If looking for a specific implementation, this is a non-exhaustive list of actively maintained KDE Connect implementations for different platforms:

## Contributing

We have a group to discuss development. You can access it from [Matrix](https://go.kde.org/matrix/#/#kdeconnect:kde.org). If you cannot find the correct room on Matrix, it might help if you first join the [KDE Matrix Space](https://go.kde.org/matrix/#/!OTxETzuhBDbnPqBqbP:kde.org). You can read more about [KDE's use of Matrix](https://community.kde.org/Matrix).

We also have a [mailing list](https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kdeconnect).

There's a [User Base Wiki](https://userbase.kde.org/KDEConnect) and a [Community Wiki](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect) (that we should unify at some point).

You can find taks in the [issues](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-meta/-/issues) of this repo. 

For bug reporting, please use [KDE's Bugzilla](https://bugs.kde.org). Please do not use the issue tracker in GitLab since that's for high-level tasks and planning.

Please know that all translations for all KDE apps are handled by the [localization team](https://l10n.kde.org/). If you would like to submit a translation, that should be done by working with the proper team for that language.
