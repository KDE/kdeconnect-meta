    "description": "When KDE Connect connects to a new network or at boot, it will broadcast a UDP datagram on port 1716. The datagram contains a JSON packet with type `kdeconnect.identity` with the fields `deviceId`, `protocolVersion` and the `tcpPort` where it is listening for connections. When a packet of this type is received, it will try to establish a TCP connection with the sender IP at the port specified.",
