    "description": "This packet either starts or stops a drawing tablet session. The session is started when this packet is sent with a `start` action. When it is started, it includes the information necessary to create a fake drawing tablet device on the receiver. The session is ended when this packet is sent with an `end` action, or the device disconnects. It is valid to send both a start or an end packet regardless whether a session exists or not. If a session exists and a start packet is sent, the session will be first ended, and then another session will be started. If no session exists and an end packet is sent, nothing will happen.",
